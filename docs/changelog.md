### Task F-1.3: Implement Form UI in CreateCourseModal
- Replaced the placeholder content in `CreateCourseModal.tsx` with a complete form structure.
- Applied Tailwind CSS classes to all form elements (`input`, `textarea`, `label`, `radio`, `button`) to replicate the visual styles from the legacy `forms.css` and `buttons.css`.
- Updated the modal container styling to include a frosted glass effect (`backdrop-blur`) to match the legacy `.content-card` style from `components.css`.
- Ensured form state and submission logic remained connected to the new UI elements.
